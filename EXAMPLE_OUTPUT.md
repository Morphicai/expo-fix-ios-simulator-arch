# Plugin Output Examples

## On Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4)

When running `npx expo prebuild --platform ios` on an Apple Silicon Mac:

```bash
$ npx expo prebuild --platform ios

‚Ä∫ Cleaning native folders
‚Ä∫ Running prebuild

üîß iOS Simulator Architecture Fix for MorphixAI
   Current architecture: arm64 (Apple Silicon)
   Mode: Debug only
  ‚úÖ Added Debug: "EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = ""
  ‚úÖ Added Debug: "EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = ""
‚ú® Architecture fix complete for MorphixAI!
   Added: 2 configuration(s)

‚Ä∫ Created native directories
```

### What Happened?

- ‚úÖ Detected Apple Silicon architecture (arm64)
- ‚úÖ Applied fix to Debug configurations
- ‚úÖ Set `"EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = ""` in `.pbxproj`
- ‚úÖ Simulator will now work correctly on M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs

## On Intel Mac (x64)

When running `npx expo prebuild --platform ios` on an Intel Mac:

```bash
$ npx expo prebuild --platform ios

‚Ä∫ Cleaning native folders
‚Ä∫ Running prebuild

üîß iOS Simulator Architecture Fix for MorphixAI
   Current architecture: x64 (Intel)
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Skipping fix - not needed on Intel Mac

‚Ä∫ Created native directories
```

### What Happened?

- ‚úÖ Detected Intel architecture (x64)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped fix (not needed on Intel)
- ‚úÖ No modifications made to `.pbxproj`
- ‚úÖ Intel Mac doesn't have the arm64 exclusion issue

## Scenarios on Apple Silicon

### Scenario 1: First Time Setup

```bash
üîß iOS Simulator Architecture Fix for YourProject
   Current architecture: arm64 (Apple Silicon)
   Mode: Debug only
  ‚úÖ Added Debug: "EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = ""
‚ú® Architecture fix complete for YourProject!
   Added: 2 configuration(s)
```

**Result:** Key was added because it didn't exist.

---

### Scenario 2: Fixing Existing arm64 Exclusion

```bash
üîß iOS Simulator Architecture Fix for YourProject
   Current architecture: arm64 (Apple Silicon)
   Mode: Debug only
  ‚úÖ Fixed Debug: "EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = ""
‚ú® Architecture fix complete for YourProject!
   Fixed: 2 configuration(s)
```

**Before in .pbxproj:**
```
EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = arm64;
```

**After in .pbxproj:**
```
"EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]" = "";
```

---

### Scenario 3: Already Correctly Configured

```bash
üîß iOS Simulator Architecture Fix for YourProject
   Current architecture: arm64 (Apple Silicon)
   Mode: Debug only
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Debug: already set correctly
‚ÑπÔ∏è  No changes needed. YourProject already configured correctly.
```

**Result:** No modifications needed - configuration is already correct.

## Architecture Detection Details

The plugin uses Node.js `os.arch()` to detect the CPU architecture:

| Platform | `os.arch()` | Result | Fix Applied? |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Apple Silicon (M1) | `arm64` | Apple Silicon detected | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Apple Silicon (M2) | `arm64` | Apple Silicon detected | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Apple Silicon (M3) | `arm64` | Apple Silicon detected | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Apple Silicon (M4) | `arm64` | Apple Silicon detected | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Intel Mac | `x64` | Intel detected | ‚è≠Ô∏è No (not needed) |

---

## Benefits of Architecture Detection

### ‚úÖ Efficiency
- Only modifies when necessary
- Intel Macs skip unnecessary operations

### ‚úÖ Compatibility
- Works correctly on both architectures
- No performance impact on Intel Macs

### ‚úÖ Clarity
- Clear console output shows what's happening
- Easy to understand why fix is applied or skipped

### ‚úÖ Team Collaboration
- Team members on different Mac types can collaborate seamlessly
- Same `app.config.js` works for everyone
- Each developer gets the right behavior for their machine
